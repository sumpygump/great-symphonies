# Great Symphonies

Lyrics applied to the core melodies to some of the best symphonies from Sigmund Spaeth's book.

# About

Sigmund Spaeth wrote a book called "Great Symphonies: How to Recognize and
Remember Them." originally published in 1936 by Garden City Publishing Co.

The book covers the selected symphonies composed from Haydn to Dvořák. For each
symphony he pulled out the melodic lines prevelant in each movement and put
lyrics to them as a way to remember them.

> The 350 musical illustrations are a practical index to the melodic materials
> of the great symphonies, and the fact that they are fitted with simple words
> makes them easy for anyone to memorize. By this novel system, every symphony
> becomes quickly recognizable and understandable, simple and enjoyable to
> follow either in the concert hall or when heard over the air.

The goal of this site is to provide an index of each of the melodies
highlighted by Mr. Spaeth in one place, as I could not find a summary on the
Internet. I recommend finding a copy of the book and reading it as it provides
a good description of each of the symphonic adventures and this site is a good
companion to review and enjoy each symphony anew.
